In between this fix skeleton, steel rods manage shade through sun screens, energy production through photovoltaic panels, temporary exhibitions structures always available. Thus the project proposes two parallel surfaces, the ground and the roof. The soil is first a regular surface, than a topography of rubber for little kids to enjoy and explore.

        description: 'Lanzarote is one of those rare and therefore precious places in the world where you don’t just pass by. To be in Lanzarote you have to go there, wish it plan it study it and only then live it. Walking around Lanzarote you hardly encounter with lies. What you see is what actually exists, no pretendings and naïve hopes, no coverings and claddings. The over-designed details and hazardous cantilevers are left for the northern regions - Nature here doesn’t allow it. The winds blow strong, the ocean marks time and the Sun is real Sun. The white walls are as white as it can get. The sky blue is as intense as it can be - loosing up the nerves and relaxing the eyes of the wanderers. The earth is earth without doubts - few elements are allowed to mark it, single rocks, solitary cactus plants, solid ancient inhabitants. Architecture on the Island is indeed not designed by man but by Nature itself. Only in such manner it can last time and elements. The CA’VIVA project transforms a banal concrete structure in a everlasting island architecture. It uses traditional materials - bricks, stones, white plaster - to create the most heat-responsive space, a patio. The core of the project is a main central patio, heart of the building it hosts shows and performances. This is formed by the coming together of four pure objects, four towers hosting on two inside levels all the provided facilities. Rehearsal rooms, recording studios, collective spaces, bar, services. The distribution is mainly horizontal and it sees at first floor a wide promenade connecting the single towers and units. This overlooks down to the lower level central patio and provides seatings for visitors and audience during shows and events. At ground floor, a generous space is dedicated to dance and rehearsals while at first floor a small administration office and collective co-working provide more silent spaces to study and work. The simplicity of the main structure -double layered bricks with external plaster finishing- is then counter parted by the and efficacious of the recording studios -independent wooden structure air gapped and acoustically isolated. The intelligence of the site, the wisdom of the island and it’s inhabitants are to be pursued in any intervention one aims to realise on this piece of land surrounded by deep waters. This is truly the the effort to realise architecture with with no architects.',

        description: 'Studying the original plans by de la Sota and the further expansions, we see how the village has grown respectful to the prime concept of the five main squares, with a longitudinal expansion along the southern side. The new LineScape project is the fulfilment of that design and the reassumption of de la Sota’s vision. With its linear expansion along the entire northern bank it physically keeps together the five squares and the new expansions. The LineScape project is a non-building that extends for 760 linear meters and has a 9 meter wide section, adapting to the natural topography of the hilly side. It is first of all a linear path way, an urban corridor, a slow infrastructure for daily strolls; and secondly an outline limit for future expansions, to be filled with units according to the village’s growth and needs. Over a total surface of 6’840 sqm, the LineScape project has a capacity of 4’560 buildable sqm and it is designed to offer different functions and spaces: residential units, public functions, sports facilities with natural swimming pool, kindergartens, temporary residential units, working spaces and facilities for distillery and dry rooms, related to the new herbal cultivations.  It is characterised by a simple almost elementary primer structure, with steel pillars and beams supporting a corrugated sheet with concrete slabs. In between the two fix slabs, the units are placed throughout time according to future expansions.The LineScape project may appear like a strong drift in the quiet environment of these rural settlements, yet its proportions and human scale respond gently to the topography of the site, while its facilities respond and adapt to the villages need throughout the years. The project aims to be more of a silent landscape intervention than a single architecture project.',

In quei giorni di tarda estate la pietra bianca rifletteva ancor di più il sole e lei non desiderava altro che raggiungere casa per dare riposo alle alla sua povera fronte. In giardino come sempre Lalita s’arrampicava sui massi calcarei, incurante del caldo, con il parasole che a volte era mongolfiera, a volte ali d’uccello, ma mai dispositivo d’ombra. “Non so proprio come faccia, scalza sui massi tutto il giorno” pensò Gauri vedendola e le gridò “vieni dentro Lalita o il sole ti cuocerà”. Ella incurante sorrise e saltò via verso altri massi da scalare. Gauri era arrivata alla parete di pietra quando sospinse la porta e questa lentamente rotò . Ogni volta che si apriva questa le ricordava i mille libri di tesori che suo padre le leggeva da bambina, e sorrideva, sempre. Al suono di quella rotazione silenziosa il piccolo Ram accorse come di consueto per vedere chi era, “Gauri!”. Il fresco della roccia fu d’improvviso ristoro e la gentile penombra della sala d’entrata di casa fu subito sollievo per la pelle arsa. Gauri posò la borsa sulla seduta, si tolse le scarpe, abbracciò il piccolo, ed insieme accesero un incenso di legno di sandalo per Shri Shiva. Inchinandosi dolcemente, bisbigliò lei tre volte, “Sat Chit Ananda Rupam, Shivo Ham Shivo Ham”. La grande statua di Shiva Nataraja, portata anni addietro dalle verdi colline del Kerala ed ora riposta nella nicchia, proteggeva coloro che uscivano dalla porta di casa e invitava coloro che entravano. E i ragazzi non dimenticavano mai di tenere un incenso acceso sull’altare, gelsomino era di Lalita, patchouli di Ram e sandalo di Gauri. Mano nella mano, Gauri aiutò il piccolo a salire i due gradini ed entrarono in casa, dove la più gentile luce del nord riempiva ora e sempre il soggiorno. ',
