        description: 'In 1928 the german architect and philosopher Herman Sorgel proposed his project for an isolated and lowered mediterranean sea, named Atlantropa. His vision was to close the Strait of Gibraltar with a portentous hydroelectric dam; lock the Suez Canal to the Red Sea; and cut off the Black Sea through the Dardanelles.It was his belief that this international and collective endeavour would bring peace among all the participants once the appearance of new agricultural land came to fruition due to the lowering of the sea levels. Being the son of a hydroelectric engineer, Sorgel thought of Atlantropa as something more than a mere utopia: he studied the construction details and figures of the epic operation for 20 years, and never ceased to strive for its completion. Nearly a century after this meta-continental project was conceptualised, we can attempt to adopt his solution to question the geopolitical borders of contemporary Europe. Focusing on the Strait of Gibraltar, the so called “first world” is separated from the “third world” by a narrow strip of water: a rupture that is not only physical but overall cultural and political.This visual exercise aims at using Sorgel’s historical power dam at the entrance of the Mediterranean to re-question the idea of national and continental frontier between Europe and northern Africa. Could a geophysical border become an architecture to live, a threshold to dwell? Could a power dam become a buffer zone for cultural and social mixitè?From Sorgel’s Atlantropa, to Le Corbusier’s Plan Obus; from Constant’s New Babylon to Kenzo Tange’s Tokyo Bay, the images propose a large infrastructure, prompted by XX century’s utopias and mega projects. A monument that is continuous in its political value and cultural bridging function',

Between these peculiarities one can note the emergence of the subjective author in an exposition usually specialistic and disciplinary. The paper brings together portions of text from some of the Italian maestri of recent architectural theory such as, Vittorio Gregotti, Aldo Rossi, Giancarlo De Carlo, to comprehend how writing may become a sharp tool for the communication of a project and its cultural legitimacy. This contribution intends to highlight how the language(Italian) of the architectural text varies when in the theoretical discourse, the description of the project is equaled by the description of the subject.",

Writings of John Ruskin (1819-1900), theoretical scholar of the Victorian period, will here be used for their clear definition of architecture as a tool for an expressed purpose: the establishment of a better society and the formation of personal character through an act of education. Once clarified the objective of the work to pursue, this paper presents the characteristics of innovation in architecture when utilised as a practical instrument, through the theoretical classifications of different scholars of the 20th Century.',
